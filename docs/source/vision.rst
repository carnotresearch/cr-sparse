Computer Vision and Image Processing 
======================================

This module contains some utilities for image processing
and computer vision. 


.. note::

    CR-Sparse doesn't intend to be a full
    fledged image processing and computer vision solution.
    The utilities in this module are meant to complement 
    the functionality available in CR-Sparse to demonstrate
    how they can be used on images.
