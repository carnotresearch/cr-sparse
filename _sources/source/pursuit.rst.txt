.. rubric:: Algorithm versions

Several algorithms are available in multiple versions.

The library allows a dictionary or a sensing process to be represented as either:

* A matrix of real/complex values
* A linear operator with fast implementation (see ``cr.sparse.lop`` module)

E.g. a partial sensing sensing matrix can be implemented more efficiently using a linear operator consisting of 
applying the fourier transform followed by selecting a subset of fourier measurements. 

* A prefix ``matrix_`` indicates an implementation which accepts matrices as dictionaries or compressive sensors.
* A prefix ``operator_`` indicates an implementation which accepts linear operators described in ``cr.sparse.lop`` module as dictionaries or compressive sensors.

* A suffix ``_jit`` means that it is the JIT (Just In Time ) compiled version of the original implementation.
* A suffix ``_multi`` means that it is the version of implementation which can process multiple signals/measurement vectors 
  simultaneously. The recovery problem :math:`y = \Phi x + e` is extended to :math:`Y = \Phi X + E` such that:

  * Each column of :math:`Y` represents one signal/measurement vector
  * Each column of :math:`X` represents one representation vector to be recovered
  * Each column of :math:`E` representation corresponding measurement error/noise.


.. rubric:: Conditions on dictionaries/sensing matrices

Different algorithms have different requirements on the dictionaries or sensing matrices:

* Some algorithms accept overcomplete dictionaries/sensing matrices with unit norm columns 
* Some algorithms accept overcomplete dictionaries/sensing matrices with orthogonal rows
* Some algorithms accept any overcomplete dictionary

Using the greedy algorithms
-------------------------------

These algorithms solve the inverse problem :math:`y = \Phi x + e` where :math:`\Phi` and :math:`y`
are known and :math:`x` is desired with :math:`\Phi` being an overcomplete dictionary or a sensing matrix.

For sparse approximation problems, we require the following to invoke any of these algorithms:

* A sparsifying dictionary :math:`\Phi`.
* A signal :math:`y` which is expected to have a sparse or compressible representation :math:`x` in :math:`\Phi`.

For sparse recovery problems, we require the following to invoke any of these algorithms:

* A sensing matrix :math:`\Phi` with suitable RIP or other properties.
* A measurement vector :math:`y` generated by applying :math:`\Phi` to a sparse signal :math:`x`

.. rubric:: A synthetic example

Build a Gaussian dictionary/sensing matrix::

  from jax import random
  import cr.sparse.dict as crdict
  M = 128
  N = 256
  key = random.PRNGKey(0)
  Phi = crdict.gaussian_mtx(key, M,N)

Build a K-sparse signal with Gaussian non-zero entries::

  import cr.sparse.data as crdata
  import jax.numpy as jnp
  K = 16
  key, subkey = random.split(key)
  x, omega = crdata.sparse_normal_representations(key, N, K, 1)
  x = jnp.squeeze(x)

Build the measurement vector::

  y = Phi @ x

We have built the necessary inputs for a sparse recovery problem. It is time to run the solver.

Import a sparse recovery solver::

  from cr.sparse.pursuit import cosamp

Solve the recovery problem::

  solution =  cosamp.matrix_solve(Phi, y, K)

You can choose any other solver. 

The support for the non-zero entries in the solution is given by ``solution.I`` and
the values for non-zero entries are given by ``solution.x_I``. You can build the
sparse representation as follows::

  from cr.sparse import build_signal_from_indices_and_values
  x_hat = build_signal_from_indices_and_values(N, solution.I, solution.x_I)

Finally, you can use the utility to evaluate the quality of reconstruction::

  from cr.sparse.ef import RecoveryPerformance
  rp = RecoveryPerformance(Phi, y, x, x_hat)
  rp.print()

This would output something like::

  M: 128, N: 256, K: 16
  x_norm: 3.817, y_norm: 3.922
  x_hat_norm: 3.817, h_norm: 1.55e-06, r_norm: 1.72e-06
  recovery_snr: 127.83 dB, measurement_snr: 127.16 dB
