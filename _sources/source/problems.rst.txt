Introduction
----------------

The ``cr.sparse.problems`` module contains a number of test
problems which can be used to quickly evaluate the correctness
and performance of a sparse recovery algorithm. The design of
these test problems is heavily influenced by Sparco \cite{sparco:2007}.
We have ported several synthetic and real life problems from Sparco
to ``CR-Sparse``.


The sparse recovery problems can be modeled as (underdetermined)
linear systems:

.. math::

    \bb = \bA \bx + \br

where :math:`\bA` is an :math:`m \times n` linear operator (real or complex),
:math:`\bb` is an observed measurement vector of length :math:`m` and :math:`\br`
is an unknown measurement noise vector.
Our goal is to reconstruct :math:`\bx` from the observed :math:`\bb`. We
have access to the linear operator :math:`\bA`.

Under compressive sensing paradigm, we may have signals :math:`\by` which
have a sparse representation in some sparsifying basis (or dictionary)
:math:`\Psi` and we sample :math:`\by` via a measurement matrix :math:`\Phi`
given by the equation:

.. math::

    \bb = \Phi \by.


Expanding :math:`\by`, we get:

.. math::

    \bb = \Phi \Psi \bx

By letting :math:`\bA = \Phi \Psi`, we go back to the original formulation
:math:`\bb = \bA \bx` (assuming no noise).

:math:`\bb` belongs to the measurement space.
:math:`\by` belongs to the signal space.
:math:`\bx` belongs to the representation space (or model space).


This module provides a ``generate`` function which can be used to generate
specific test problems. Each problem has been given a name and you will need
to pass the name to the generate function (along with other problem specific
parameters) to generate an instance of a problem. 
The list of problems is provided below.

An instance of a problem is described by a named tuple
``Problem``.  This tuple has following attributes:

    :header-rows: 1

    * - Attribute
      - Description
    * - name
      - Name of the test problem
    * - Phi
      - A linear operator :math:`\Phi` representing the
        compressive sensing process.
        It may be identity operator if no sensing is involved.
    * - Psi
      - A linear operator :math:`\Psi` representing the sparsifying basis.
        It may be identity operator if the signal is sparse in itself.
    * - A
      - The combined linear operator :math:`\bA = \Phi \Psi`.
        If either :math:`\Phi` or :math:`\Psi` are identity, then
        :math:`\bA` bypasses them.
    * - b
      - An array :math:`\bb` representing observed measurements.
        For simple problems, it is a vector (1D array). For more
        advanced problems, it may be an nd array (e.g. an image).
    * - reconstruct
      - A function to construct :math:`\by` from :math:`\bx`.
        Typically, it is the application of the sparsifying basis
        operator :math:`\Psi`.
    * - x
      - The sparse representation vector :math:`\bx` used to construct
        the problem. This may not be available for all problems.
        If available, it can be used to assess the quality of reconstruction.
    * - y
      - The signal :math:`\by` which is being sampled by compressive sensing.
        This may not be available for every problem. If available, it can
        be used for comparing the reconstructed signal with the original
        signal.
    * - figures
      - Titles of a list of figures associated with the problem.
    * - plot
      - A function to plot individual figures associated with the problem.
        The figures are useful in visualizing the problem.


.. note::

    While the equation :math:`\bb  = \bA \bx` looks like a matrix
    vector equation, we should treat it as the application of
    a linear operator :math:`\bA` on the data :math:`bx`.
    The data may be a vector or an image or a multi-channel audio
    signal. The implementation of the linear operator :math:`\bA`
    would know how to handle the data layout.
    One can flatten
    the arrays :math:`\bx` and :math:`\bb` to construct the corresponding
    matrix vector linear system.
    However, the matrices for the flattened systems tend to be
    quite sparse and hence not very efficient computationally.
