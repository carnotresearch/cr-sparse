Frequency Change Detection
===============================

This example considers a signal which is a sinusoid whose
frequency changes abruptly at a specific point in time.
Looking at the waveform of the signal, it is very difficult
to identify the time where the frequency change occurs.
However, when we perform the wavelet decomposition of the
signal, we can clearly see the location at which the
discontinuity in frequency occurs.

We will do the following:

- Synthetically construct a sinusoid with two different frequencies
  at different times.
- Examine its Fourier spectrum which cannot reveal this discontinuity.
- Perform multilevel wavelet decomposition.
- Visually inspect the detail coefficients at multiple levels to 
  locate the discontinuity
- Algorithmically locate the discontinuity by scanning the detail 
  coefficients.

The last plot shows the combined signal with discontinuity at t=12 sec when
the frequency changes from 1/8 Hz to 1/6 Hz.
The change is very difficult to notice as well as locate in the time domain plot of the signal.

The frequencies 1/6 and 1/8 Hz are so close that it is difficult to distinguish them 
in the frequency spectrum. Of course, location of the discontinuity cannot be 
identified in the frequency spectrum.

The discontinuities are clearly visible in the plots of detail coefficients 
both at first level and second level.
The detail coefficients have been aligned with the time values.
Both plots should large coefficients around t=12 sec.
Large coefficients at the boundary are due to boundary effects in DWT and can be safely ignored.

After ignoring the first couple of entries for the boundary effects
at the beginning of the data, we can see that the discontinuity
has been correctly identified at sample 1200 which happens to 
correspond to t=12 sec.
