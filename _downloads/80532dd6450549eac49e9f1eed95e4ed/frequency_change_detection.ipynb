        "\n# Frequency Change Detection\n\nThis example considers a signal which is a sinusoid whose\nfrequency changes abruptly at a specific point in time.\nLooking at the waveform of the signal, it is very difficult\nto identify the time where the frequency change occurs.\nHowever, when we perform the wavelet decomposition of the\nsignal, we can clearly see the location at which the\ndiscontinuity in frequency occurs.\n\nWe will do the following:\n\n- Synthetically construct a sinusoid with two different frequencies\n  at different times.\n- Examine its Fourier spectrum which cannot reveal this discontinuity.\n- Perform multilevel wavelet decomposition.\n- Visually inspect the detail coefficients at multiple levels to \n  locate the discontinuity\n- Algorithmically locate the discontinuity by scanning the detail \n  coefficients.\n"
